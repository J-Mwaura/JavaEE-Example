This is a Java EE application. It is an example of a blog web system that demonstrates major functionarities of 
Java EE. I developed this app a while ago using Java 7 but it runs on Java 8 as well.
The program uses MySQL database (sql scripts with create and inset statemens are provided).
The key takeaway from this work is how to use Enterprise Java Beans. 
You will see how sessions beans are written and how to use the capabilities of PersistenceContext.
What the app does
//----------------------------------------------------//
The app uses Java mail Api for messaging
A user can register with an email.
A verification email will be sent to their mail box for verification.
Change of password where a renew password link is sent to the registered email.
Make changes to the setup file to allow registration with email.
